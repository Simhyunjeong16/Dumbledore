They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you\'re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.\n I Albus Dumbledore will award points on your behalf. Just say `10 points to Gryffindor` + or `5 points to @benc` to award points',
